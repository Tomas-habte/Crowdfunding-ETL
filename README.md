# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview

In this module, we used the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to collect, clean, and store data in a database. We first used  Python and Pandas to perform the extract and transform steps. Then, we created a PostgreSQL database and table schemas by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD), and loaded the data into the database.
